TI  - Substrate-assisted catalysis in the aminoacyl transfer mechanism of histidyl-tRNA
      synthetase: a density functional theory study.
PG  - 16874-82
LID - 10.1021/jp807104b [doi]
AB  - Density functional theory methods have been used to investigate possible
      mechanisms of the second half-reaction of aminoacylation catalyzed by
      histidyl-tRNA synthetase: transfer of the aminoacyl moiety from
      histidyl-adenylate to the terminal adenosine (A76) of tRNA. The properties of the
      two mechanistically important nonbridging phosphate oxygens of the
      histidyl-adenylate in the substrate-bound complex were first considered. It is
      found that the nonbridging pro-S oxygen is slightly more basic than the pro-R
      oxygen due to the fact that the former is involved in a weaker hydrogen bonding
      network than the latter. Three possible mechanisms in which the proton of the
      3'-OH group of A76 transfers to the bridging phosphate oxygen and the nonbridging
      pro-R and -S oxygens were then investigated. When the bridging phosphate oxygen
      acts as the base, the reaction occurs via a four-membered ring transition
      structure with a considerably high barrier. When the pro-R oxygen acts as the
      base, a concerted mechanism was again found. However, it proceeds via a
      six-membered ring transition structure. In contrast, when the pro-S oxygen acts
      as a base, an associative stepwise mechanism was found which, furthermore, also
      had the lowest barrier of the three mechanisms obtained. Comparisons of these
      three mechanisms and reasons for the differences in barriers are also provided.

AB  - Maintenance of amino acid specificity by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, particularly
      prolyl-tRNA synthetase, requires for not only specific recognition of homologic
      amino acid, but also missynthesized products hydrolysis, known as editing. The
      speeding-up of the enzymatic hydrolysis of missynthesized alanyl adenylate by
      bacteria Enterococcus faecalis prolyl-tRNA synthetase in the presence of tRNAPro,
      and also importance for this function of 2'- and 3'-hydroxyle groups of tRNA
      3'-terminal adenosine ribose is shown in the work. Furthermore, results are
      shown, that support the absence of editing (INS) domain role in alanyl adenylate 
      hydrolysis. Possible significance of tRNA-dependent alanyl adenylate hydrolysis
      by prolyl-tRNA synthetase for prolyl-tRNAPro synthesis specificity maintenance is
      discussed.

AB  - Mounting evidence shows that tRNA modifications play crucial roles in the
      maintenance of wild-type levels of several tRNA species. This chapter describes a
      generalized framework in which to study tRNA turnover in the yeast Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae as a consequence of a defect in tRNA modification status. It describes
      several approaches for the identification of tRNA species that are reduced as a
      consequence of a modification defect, methods for analysis of the rate of tRNA
      loss and analysis of its aminoacylation, and methods for initial characterization
      of tRNA turnover. These approaches have been used successfully for several
      modification defects that result in tRNA turnover.

TI  - Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase-tRNA(Pyl) structure reveals the molecular basis of
      orthogonality.
PG  - 1163-7
LID - 10.1038/nature07611 [doi]
AB  - Pyrrolysine (Pyl), the 22nd natural amino acid, is genetically encoded by UAG and
      inserted into proteins by the unique suppressor tRNA(Pyl) (ref. 1). The
      Methanosarcinaceae produce Pyl and express Pyl-containing methyltransferases that
      allow growth on methylamines. Homologous methyltransferases and the Pyl
      biosynthetic and coding machinery are also found in two bacterial species. Pyl
      coding is maintained by pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), which catalyses the
      formation of Pyl-tRNA(Pyl) (refs 4, 5). Pyl is not a recent addition to the
      genetic code. PylRS was already present in the last universal common ancestor; it
      then persisted in organisms that utilize methylamines as energy sources. Recent
      protein engineering efforts added non-canonical amino acids to the genetic code. 
      This technology relies on the directed evolution of an 'orthogonal' tRNA
      synthetase-tRNA pair in which an engineered aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS)
      specifically and exclusively acylates the orthogonal tRNA with a non-canonical
      amino acid. For Pyl the natural evolutionary process developed such a system some
      3 billion years ago. When transformed into Escherichia coli, Methanosarcina
      barkeri PylRS and tRNA(Pyl) function as an orthogonal pair in vivo. Here we show 
      that Desulfitobacterium hafniense PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) is an orthogonal pair in vitro 
      and in vivo, and present the crystal structure of this orthogonal pair. The
      ancient emergence of PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) allowed the evolution of unique structural
      features in both the protein and the tRNA. These structural elements manifest an 
      intricate, specialized aaRS-tRNA interaction surface that is highly distinct from
      those observed in any other known aaRS-tRNA complex; it is this general property 
      that underlies the molecular basis of orthogonality.

AB  - Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS), an aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (aaRS) recently 
      found in some methanogenic archaea and bacteria, recognizes an unusually large
      lysine derivative, L-pyrrolysine, as the substrate, and attaches it to the
      cognate tRNA (tRNA(Pyl)). The PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) pair interacts with none of the
      endogenous aaRS-tRNA pairs in Escherichia coli, and thus can be used as a novel
      aaRS-tRNA pair for genetic code expansion. The crystal structures of the
      Methanosarcina mazei PylRS revealed that it has a unique, large pocket for amino 
      acid binding, and the wild type M. mazei PylRS recognizes the natural lysine
      derivative as well as many lysine analogs, including
      N(epsilon)-(tert-butoxycarbonyl)-L-lysine (Boc-lysine), with diverse side chain
      sizes and structures. Moreover, the PylRS only loosely recognizes the alpha-amino
      group of the substrate, whereas most aaRSs, including the structurally and
      genetically related phenylalanyl-tRNA synthetase (PheRS), strictly recognize the 
      main chain groups of the substrate. We report here that wild type PylRS can
      recognize substrates with a variety of main-chain alpha-groups:
      alpha-hydroxyacid, non-alpha-amino-carboxylic acid, N(alpha)-methyl-amino acid,
      and D-amino acid, each with the same side chain as that of Boc-lysine. In
      contrast, PheRS recognizes none of these amino acid analogs. By expressing the
      wild type PylRS and its cognate tRNA(Pyl) in E. coli in the presence of the
      alpha-hydroxyacid analog of Boc-lysine (Boc-LysOH), the amber codon (UAG) was
      recoded successfully as Boc-LysOH, and thus an ester bond was site-specifically
      incorporated into a protein molecule. This PylRS-tRNA(Pyl) pair is expected to
      expand the backbone diversity of protein molecules produced by both in vivo and
      in vitro ribosomal translation.

TI  - Thermodynamic analysis reveals a temperature-dependent change in the catalytic
      mechanism of bacillus stearothermophilus tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase.
PG  - 4179-90
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M808500200 [doi]
AB  - Catalysis of tRNA(Tyr) aminoacylation by tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase can be divided
      into two steps. In the first step, tyrosine is activated by ATP to form the
      tyrosyl-adenylate intermediate. In the second step, the tyrosyl moiety is
      transferred to the 3' end of tRNA. To investigate the roles that enthalpic and
      entropic contributions play in catalysis by Bacillus stearothermophilus
      tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase (TyrRS), the temperature dependence for the activation of
      tyrosine and subsequent transfer to tRNA(Tyr) has been determined using single
      turnover kinetic methods. A van't Hoff plot for binding of ATP to the TyrRS.Tyr
      complex reveals three distinct regions. Particularly striking is the change
      occurring at 25 degrees C, where the values of DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0) go from
      -144 kJ/mol and -438 J/mol K below 25 degrees C to +137.9 kJ/mol and +507 J/mol K
      above 25 degrees C. Nonlinear Eyring and van't Hoff plots are also observed for
      formation of the TyrRS.[Tyr-ATP](double dagger) and TyrRS.Tyr-AMP complexes.
      Comparing the van't Hoff plots for the binding of ATP to tyrosyl-tRNA synthetase 
      in the absence and presence of saturating tyrosine concentrations indicates that 
      the temperature-dependent changes in DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0) for the binding of
      ATP only occur when tyrosine is bound to the enzyme. Previous investigations
      revealed a similar synergistic interaction between the tyrosine and ATP
      substrates when the "KMSKS" signature sequence is deleted or replaced by a
      nonfunctional sequence. We propose that the temperature-dependent changes in
      DeltaH(0) and DeltaS(0) are because of the KMSKS signature sequence being
      conformationally constrained and unable to disrupt this synergistic interaction
      below 25 degrees C.

PG  - 161-6
LID - 10.1038/nature07582 [doi]
AB  - The overall fidelity of protein synthesis has been thought to rely on the
      combined accuracy of two basic processes: the aminoacylation of transfer RNAs
      with their cognate amino acid by the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases, and the
      selection of cognate aminoacyl-tRNAs by the ribosome in cooperation with the
      GTPase elongation factor EF-Tu. These two processes, which together ensure the
      specific acceptance of a correctly charged cognate tRNA into the aminoacyl (A)
      site, operate before peptide bond formation. Here we report the identification of
      an additional mechanism that contributes to high fidelity protein synthesis after
      peptidyl transfer, using a well-defined in vitro bacterial translation system. In
      this retrospective quality control step, the incorporation of an amino acid from 
      a non-cognate tRNA into the growing polypeptide chain leads to a general loss of 
      specificity in the A site of the ribosome, and thus to a propagation of errors
      that results in abortive termination of protein synthesis.

TI  - Evidence from glycine transfer RNA of a frozen accident at the dawn of the
      genetic code.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Transfer RNA (tRNA) is the means by which the cell translates DNA
      sequence into protein according to the rules of the genetic code. A credible
      proposition is that tRNA was formed from the duplication of an RNA hairpin half
      the length of the contemporary tRNA molecule, with the point at which the
      hairpins were joined marked by the canonical intron insertion position found
      today within tRNA genes. If these hairpins possessed a 3'-CCA terminus with
      different combinations of stem nucleotides (the ancestral operational RNA code), 
      specific aminoacylation and perhaps participation in some form of noncoded
      protein synthesis might have occurred. However, the identity of the first tRNA
      and the initial steps in the origin of the genetic code remain elusive. RESULTS: 
      Here we show evidence that glycine tRNA was the first tRNA, as revealed by a
      vestigial imprint in the anticodon loop sequences of contemporary descendents.
      This provides a plausible mechanism for the missing first step in the origin of
      the genetic code. In 448 of 466 glycine tRNA gene sequences from bacteria,
      archaea and eukaryote cytoplasm analyzed, CCA occurs immediately upstream of the 
      canonical intron insertion position, suggesting the first anticodon (NCC for
      glycine) has been captured from the 3'-terminal CCA of one of the interacting
      hairpins as a result of an ancestral ligation. CONCLUSION: That this imprint
      (including the second and third nucleotides of the glycine tRNA anticodon) has
      been retained through billions of years of evolution suggests Crick's 'frozen
      accident' hypothesis has validity for at least this very first step at the dawn
      of the genetic code. REVIEWERS: This article was reviewed by Dr Eugene V. Koonin,
      Dr Rob Knight and Dr David H Ardell.

TI  - Specificity of pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase for pyrrolysine and pyrrolysine
      analogs.
PG  - 1156-64
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.11.032 [doi]
AB  - Pyrrolysine, the 22nd amino acid, is encoded by amber (TAG=UAG) codons in certain
      methanogenic archaea and bacteria. PylS, the pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase, ligates 
      pyrrolysine to tRNA(Pyl) for amber decoding as pyrrolysine. PylS and tRNA(Pyl)
      have potential utility in making tailored recombinant proteins. Here, we probed
      interactions necessary for recognition of substrates by archaeal PylS via
      synthesis of close pyrrolysine analogs and testing their reactivity in amino acid
      activation assays. Replacement of the methylpyrroline ring of pyrrolysine with
      cyclopentane indicated that solely hydrophobic interactions with the ring-binding
      pocket of PylS are sufficient for substrate recognition. However, a 100-fold
      increase in the specificity constant of PylS was observed with an analog,
      2-amino-6-((R)-tetrahydrofuran-2-carboxamido)hexanoic acid (2Thf-lys), in which
      tetrahydrofuran replaced the pyrrolysine methylpyrroline ring. Other analogs in
      which the electronegative atom was moved to different positions suggested PylS
      preference for a hydrogen-bond-accepting group at the imine nitrogen position in 
      pyrrolysine. 2Thf-lys was a preferred substrate over a commonly employed
      pyrrolysine analog, but the specificity constant for 2Thf-lys was 10-fold lower
      than for pyrrolysine itself, largely due to the change in K(m). The in vivo
      activity of the analogs in supporting UAG suppression in Escherichia coli bearing
      genes for PylS and tRNA(Pyl) was similar to in vitro results, with L-pyrrolysine 
      and 2Thf-lys supporting the highest amounts of UAG translation. Increasing
      concentrations of either PylS substrate resulted in a linear increase in UAG
      suppression, providing a facile method to assay bioactive pyrrolysine analogs.
      These results illustrate the relative importance of the H-bonding and hydrophobic
      interactions in the recognition of the methylpyrroline ring of pyrrolysine and
      provide a promising new series of easily synthesized pyrrolysine analogs that can
      serve as scaffolds for the introduction of novel functional groups into
      recombinant proteins.

AB  - Pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) esterifies pyrrolysine to tRNA(Pyl). In this
      study, N(epsilon)-(tert-butyloxycarbonyl)-L-lysine (BocLys) and
      N(epsilon)-allyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (AlocLys) were esterified to tRNA(Pyl) by
      PylRS. Crystal structures of a PylRS catalytic fragment complexed with BocLys and
      an ATP analog and with AlocLys-AMP revealed that PylRS requires an
      N(epsilon)-carbonyl group bearing a substituent with a certain size. A
      PylRS(Y384F) mutant obtained by random screening exhibited higher in vitro
      aminoacylation and in vivo amber suppression activities with BocLys, AlocLys, and
      pyrrolysine than those of the wild-type PylRS. Furthermore, the structure-based
      Y306A mutation of PylRS drastically increased the in vitro aminoacylation
      activity for N(epsilon)-benzyloxycarbonyl-L-lysine (ZLys). A PylRS with both the 
      Y306A and Y384F mutations enabled the large-scale preparation (>10 mg per liter
      medium) of proteins site-specifically containing
      N(epsilon)-(o-azidobenzyloxycarbonyl)-L-lysine (AzZLys). The AzZLys-containing
      protein was labeled with a fluorescent probe, by Staudinger ligation.

AB  - Mistranslation is toxic to bacterial and mammalian cells and can lead to
      neurodegeneration in the mouse. Mistranslation is caused by the attachment of the
      wrong amino acid to a specific tRNA. Many aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases have an
      editing activity that deacylates the mischarged amino acid before capture by the 
      elongation factor and transport to the ribosome. For class I tRNA synthetases,
      the editing activity is encoded by the CP1 domain, which is distinct from the
      active site for aminoacylation. What is not clear is whether the enzymes also
      have an editing activity that is separable from CP1. A point mutation in CP1 of
      class I leucyl-tRNA synthetase inactivates deacylase activity and produces
      misacylated tRNA. In contrast, although deletion of the entire CP1 domain also
      disabled the deacylase activity, the deletion-bearing enzyme produced no
      mischarged tRNA. Further investigation showed that a second tRNA-dependent
      activity prevented misacylation and is intrinsic to the active site for
      aminoacylation.

TI  - Inhibition of methionyl-tRNA synthetase by REP8839 and effects of resistance
      mutations on enzyme activity.
PG  - 86-94
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00275-08 [doi]
AB  - REP8839 is a selective inhibitor of methionyl-tRNA synthetase (MetRS) with
      antibacterial activity against a variety of gram-positive organisms. We
      determined REP8839 potency against Staphylococcus aureus MetRS and assessed its
      selectivity for bacterial versus human orthologs of MetRS. The inhibition
      constant (K(i)) of REP8839 was 10 pM for Staphylococcus aureus MetRS. Inhibition 
      of MetRS by REP8839 was competitive with methionine and uncompetitive with ATP.
      Thus, high physiological ATP levels would actually facilitate optimal binding of 
      the inhibitor. While many gram-positive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, 
      express exclusively the MetRS1 subtype, many gram-negative bacteria express an
      alternative homolog called MetRS2. Some gram-positive bacteria, such as
      Streptococcus pneumoniae and Bacillus anthracis, express both MetRS1 and MetRS2. 
      MetRS2 orthologs were considerably less susceptible to REP8839 inhibition.
      REP8839 inhibition of human mitochondrial MetRS was 1,000-fold weaker than
      inhibition of Staphylococcus aureus MetRS; inhibition of human cytoplasmic MetRS 
      was not detectable, corresponding to >1,000,000-fold selectivity for the
      bacterial target relative to its cytoplasmic counterpart. Mutations in MetRS that
      confer reduced susceptibility to REP8839 were examined. The mutant MetRS enzymes 
      generally exhibited substantially impaired catalytic activity, particularly in
      aminoacylation turnover rates. REP8839 K(i) values ranged from 4- to 190,000-fold
      higher for the mutant enzymes than for wild-type MetRS. These observations
      provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the reduced growth fitness
      observed with MetRS mutant strains relative to that with wild-type Staphylococcus
      aureus.

TI  - On the role of an unusual tRNAGly isoacceptor in Staphylococcus aureus.
PG  - 344-51
LID - 10.1016/j.biochi.2008.10.009 [doi]
AB  - In the available Staphylococcus aureus genomes, four different genes have been
      annotated to encode tRNA(Gly) isoacceptors. Besides their prominent role in
      protein synthesis, some of them also participate in the formation of pentaglycine
      bridges during cell wall synthesis. However, until today, it is not known how
      many and which of them are actually involved in this essential procedure. In the 
      present study we identified, apart from the four annotated tRNA(Gly) genes, a
      putative pseudogene which encodes and expresses an unusual fifth tRNA(Gly)
      isoacceptor in S. aureus (as detected via RT-PCR and subsequent direct sequencing
      analysis). All the in vitro transcribed tRNA(Gly) molecules (including the
      "pseudogene-encoded" tRNA(Gly)) can be efficiently aminoacylated by the
      recombinant S. aureus glycyl-tRNA synthetase. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis
      suggests that the "pseudo"-tRNA(Gly(UCC)) identified in the present study and two
      of the annotated isoacceptors bearing the same anticodon carry specific sequence 
      elements that do not favour the strong interaction with EF-Tu that proteinogenic 
      tRNAs would promote. This observation was verified by the differential capacity
      of Gly-tRNA(Gly) molecules to form ternary complexes with activated S. aureus
      EF-Tu.GTP. These tRNA(Gly) molecules display high sequence similarities with
      their S. epidermidis orthologs which also actively participate in cell wall
      synthesis. Both bioinformatic and biochemical data suggest that in S. aureus
      these three glycylated tRNA(Gly) isoacceptors that are weak EF-Tu binders,
      possibly escape protein synthesis and serve as glycine donors for the formation
      of pentaglycine bridges that are essential for stabilization of the
      staphylococcal cell wall.

      promotes aminoacylation by threonyl-tRNA synthetase.
PG  - 17748-53
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0804247105 [doi]
AB  - Aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (aaRSs) join amino acids to 1 of 2 terminal hydroxyl
      groups of their cognate tRNAs, thereby contributing to the overall fidelity of
      protein synthesis. In class II histidyl-tRNA synthetase (HisRS) the nonbridging
      S(p)-oxygen of the adenylate is a potential general base for aminoacyl transfer. 
      To test for conservation of this mechanism in other aaRSs and the role of
      terminal hydroxyls of tRNA in aminoacyl transfer, we investigated the class II
      Escherichia coli threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS). As with other class II aaRSs, 
      the rate-determining step for ThrRS is amino acid activation. In ThrRS, however, 
      the 2'-OH of A76 of tRNA(Thr) and a conserved active-site histidine (His-309)
      collaborate to catalyze aminoacyl transfer by a mechanism distinct from HisRS.
      Conserved residues in the ThrRS active site were replaced with alanine, and then 
      the resulting mutant proteins were analyzed by steady-state and rapid kinetics.
      Nearly all mutants preferentially affected the amino acid activation step, with
      only a modest effect on aminoacyl transfer. By contrast, H309A ThrRS decreased
      transfer 242-fold and imposed a kinetic block to CCA accommodation. His-309
      hydrogen bonds to the 2'-OH of A76, and substitution of the latter by hydrogen or
      fluorine decreased aminoacyl transfer by 763- and 94-fold, respectively. The
      proton relay mechanism suggested by these data to promote aminoacylation is
      reminiscent of the NAD(+)-dependent mechanisms of alcohol dehydrogenases and
      sirtuins and the RNA-mediated catalysis of the ribosomal peptidyl transferase
      center.

PG  - 12476-82
LID - 10.1021/bi8009295 [doi]
AB  - Yeast aspartyl-tRNA synthetase (AspRS) is downregulated at the
      post-transcriptional level. This complex retro-inhibition mechanism causes the
      cell to equilibrate cellular concentrations of tRNAAsp, AspRS, and its encoding
      mRNA. This strategy hinders AspRS accumulation to keep misacylation of
      heterologous tRNAs under control. Here, the AspRS concentration was increased
      artificially in vivo but did not generate tRNAAsn and/or tRNAGlu misaspartylation
      or the logical consecutive post-translational stress. This work allowed the
      detection of an additional subtle cellular lock capable of blocking AspRS
      toxicity. This study revealed the presence of post-translational modifications in
      the N-terminal extension of AspRS. We hypothesize that by neutralizing the
      lysine-rich motif contained in this domain, the cell mobilizes an additional
      strategy that considerably reduces the probability of the enzyme binding and
      aspartylating noncognate tRNAs and thus harming its own translation.

AB  - Threonyl-tRNA synthetase (ThrRS) plays an essential role in protein synthesis by 
      catalyzing the aminoacylation of tRNA(Thr) and editing misacylation. ThrRS
      generally contains an N-terminal editing domain, a catalytic domain and an
      anticodon-binding domain. The sequences of the editing domain in ThrRSs from
      archaea differ from those in bacteria and eukaryotes. Furthermore, several
      creanarchaea including Aeropyrum pernix K1 and Sulfolobus tokodaii strain 7
      contain two genes encoding either the catalytic or the editing domain of ThrRS.
      To reveal the structural basis for this evolutionary divergence, the two types of
      ThrRS from the crenarchaea A. pernix and S. tokodaii have been overexpressed in
      Eschericha coli, purified and crystallized by the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion
      method. Diffraction data were collected and the structure of a
      selenomethionine-labelled A. pernix type-1 ThrRS crystal has been solved using
      the MAD method.

TI  - DNA polymerases and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases: shared mechanisms for ensuring
      the fidelity of gene expression.
PG  - 11695-703
LID - 10.1021/bi801500z [doi]
AB  - DNA polymerases and aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (ARSs) represent large enzyme
      families with critical roles in the transformation of genetic information from
      DNA to RNA to protein. DNA polymerases carry out replication and collaborate in
      the repair of the genome, while ARSs provide aminoacylated tRNA precursors for
      protein synthesis. Enzymes of both families face the common challenge of
      selecting their cognate small molecule substrates from a pool of chemically
      related molecules, achieving high levels of discrimination with the assistance of
      proofreading mechanisms. Here, the fidelity preservation mechanisms in these two 
      important systems are reviewed and similar features highlighted. Among the
      noteworthy features common to both DNA polymerases and ARSs are the use of
      multidomain architectures that segregate synthetic and proofreading functions
      into discrete domains; the use of induced fit to enhance binding selectivity; the
      imposition of fidelity at the level of chemistry; and the use of postchemistry
      error correction mechanisms to hydrolyze incorrect products in a discrete editing
      domain. These latter mechanisms further share the common property that error
      correction involves the translocation of misincorporated products from the
      synthetic to the editing site and that the accuracy of the process may be
      influenced by the rates of translocation in either direction. Fidelity control in
      both families can thus be said to rely on multiple elementary steps, each with
      its contribution to overall fidelity. The summed contribution of these kinetic
      checkpoints provides the high observed overall accuracy of DNA replication and
      aminoacylation.

TI  - A disease-causing point mutation in human mitochondrial tRNAMet rsults in tRNA
      misfolding leading to defects in translational initiation and elongation.
PG  - 34445-56
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M806992200 [doi]
AB  - The mitochondrial tRNA genes are hot spots for mutations that lead to human
      disease. A single point mutation (T4409C) in the gene for human mitochondrial
      tRNA(Met) (hmtRNA(Met)) has been found to cause mitochondrial myopathy. This
      mutation results in the replacement of U8 in hmtRNA(Met) with a C8. The
      hmtRNA(Met) serves both in translational initiation and elongation in human
      mitochondria making this tRNA of particular interest in mitochondrial protein
      synthesis. Here we show that the single 8U-->C mutation leads to a failure of the
      tRNA to respond conformationally to Mg(2+). This mutation results in a drastic
      disruption of the structure of the hmtRNA(Met), which significantly reduces its
      aminoacylation. The small fraction of hmtRNA(Met) that can be aminoacylated is
      not formylated by the mitochondrial Met-tRNA transformylase preventing its
      function in initiation, and it is unable to form a stable ternary complex with
      elongation factor EF-Tu preventing any participation in chain elongation. We have
      used structural probing and molecular reconstitution experiments to examine the
      structures formed by the normal and mutated tRNAs. In the presence of Mg(2+), the
      normal tRNA displays the structural features expected of a tRNA. However, even in
      the presence of Mg(2+), the mutated tRNA does not form the cloverleaf structure
      typical of tRNAs. Thus, we believe that this mutation has disrupted a critical
      Mg(2+)-binding site on the tRNA required for formation of the biologically active
      structure. This work establishes a foundation for understanding the physiological
      consequences of the numerous mitochondrial tRNA mutations that result in disease 
      in humans.

TI  - Mitochondrial tRNAThr G15927A mutation may modulate the phenotypic manifestation 
      of ototoxic 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in four Chinese families.
PG  - 1059-70
LID - 10.1097/FPC.0b013e3283131661 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of mitochondrial modifiers in the development 
      of deafness associated with 12S rRNA A1555G mutation. METHODS: Four Chinese
      families with nonsyndromic and aminoglycoside-induced deafness were studied by
      clinical and genetic evaluation, molecular and biochemical analyses of
      mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). RESULTS: These families exhibited high penetrance and 
      expressivity of hearing impairment. Penetrances of hearing loss in WZD31, WZD32, 
      WZD33, and WZD34 pedigrees ranged from 50 to 67% and from 39 to 50%,
      respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced hearing loss was included or excluded. 
      Matrilineal relatives in these families developed hearing loss at the average of 
      14, 13, 16, and 15 years of age, respectively, when aminoglycoside-induced
      deafness was excluded. Mutational analysis of entire mtDNA in these families
      showed the homoplasmic A1555G mutation and distinct sets of variants belonging to
      haplogroup B5b1. Of these, the tRNA G15927A mutation locates at the fourth base
      in the anticodon stem (conventional position 42) of tRNA. A guanine (G42) at this
      position of tRNA is highly conserved from bacteria to human mitochondria. The
      lower levels and altered electrophoretic mobility of tRNA were observed in cells 
      carrying A1555G and G15927A mutations or only G15927A mutation but not cells
      carrying only A1555G mutation. The abolished base pairing (28C-42G) of this tRNA 
      by the G15927A mutation caused a failure in tRNA metabolism, worsening the
      mitochondrial dysfunctions altered by the A1555G mutation. CONCLUSION: The
      G15927A mutation has a potential modifier role in increasing the penetrance and
      expressivity of the deafness-associated 12S rRNA A1555G mutation in those Chinese
      pedigrees.

PG  - 169-77
AB  - Seryl-tRNA synthetase (SerRS) catalyzes the ligation of serine to the 3'-end of
      serine tRNA (tRNA(Ser)), which is typical of the type-2 tRNAs characterized by a 
      long extra arm. The SerRSs are divided into two types, the archaeal/eukaryal and 
      bacterial types. In this study, we solved the crystal structures of the SerRS
      from the archaeon Pyrococcus horikoshii bound with
      5'-O-[N-(L-seryl)-sulfamoyl]-adenosine at 2.6 A and with ATP at 2.8 A, as well as
      in the apo form at 3.0 A. P. horikoshii SerRS recognizes the seryl and adenylate 
      moieties in a manner similar to those of the bacterial and mitochondrial SerRSs
      from Thermus thermophilus and Bos taurus, respectively, but different from that
      of the unusual SerRS from the methanogenic archaeon Methanosarcina barkeri. P.
      horikoshii SerRS efficiently aminoacylated not only P. horikoshii tRNA(Ser) but
      also bacterial tRNA(Ser)s from T. thermophilus and Escherichia coli. Models of P.
      horikoshii SerRS bound with the T. thermophilus and P. horikoshii tRNA(Ser)s
      suggested that the helical domain of P. horikoshii SerRS is involved in the extra
      arm binding. This region of P. horikoshii SerRS has additional basic residues as 
      compared with T. thermophilus SerRS, and a Trp residue specific to the
      archaeal/eukaryal SerRSs. Mutational analyses revealed that the basic and Trp
      residues are important for tRNA aminoacylation. P. horikoshii SerRS has the
      archaea-specific insertion, which collaborates with the core domain to form a
      basic channel leading to the active site. Two sulfate ions are bound to the
      channel, suggesting that the tRNA 3' region might bind to the channel.
